# Front-End Test Developer

The application was developed using React, Redux, UI5 Web Components and SCSS, the page is focused in one for searching the movie and one for showing the list of favorite movies saved.

## Project Execution

Clone the repository and use the "npm install" or "yarn install" and execute the "npm start" or "yarn start" after the installation  of the required packages.

### Tweaks and Improvements

With more time, I would like to make some adjustments regarding the SCSS by adding new animations and greater detail on the pages, as well as I would like to add some extra features.
